Description: Upload photos to online services through an intuitive interface.
 Postman is a utility program to batch upload images to popular websites
 or services. This is done through a simple and modern intuitive user
 interface. Drag stamps to mark destinations, and drag images to select
 content. Currently Flickr, Ubuntu One, Google+ and Picasa are supported.
