Description: A batch image uploading application.
 Postman is a utility program to batch upload images to popular websites
 or services. This is done through a simple and modern intuitive user
 interface. Drag stamps to mark destinations, and drag images to select
 content. Currently Flickr and Ubuntu One are supported.
